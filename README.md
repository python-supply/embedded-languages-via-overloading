Python's extensive support for operator overloading can help you greatly reduce the conceptual complexity of your library or framework, allowing programmers who must use it to leverage the extensive knowledge and skills they already possess.

The use case in this article illustrates how operator overloading can be used to define embedded domain-specific languages that allow programmers to employ familiar Python notation and language constructs to quickly and concisely build logical circuits using a variety of underlying data structures.
